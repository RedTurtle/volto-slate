# volto-slate

An alternative text editor for Volto, capable of completely replacing the default richtext editor while offering enhanced functionality and behavior.

## Why

Some of the main reasons that drove us to create volto-slate:

- Volto's draftjs implementation depends on draft-js-plugins, a third-party project that introduces its own set of bugs and maintanance issues
- Slate has a modern, developer-friendly api that makes developing plugins something easy to do. Getting the editor in a plugin is as easy as `const editor = useSlate()`, overriding core functionality is something that's built in as pluggable, directly in Slate.
- Volto dependends on redraft for final output, which introduces its own bugs and issues. While it is nice to have view-mode components, this is something that volto-slate implements as well
- Because Slate's internal storage uses a tree modeled on the DOM pattern, its final rendered output is very clean

A lot of inspiration from the great [Slate Plugins repository](https://github.com/udecode/slate-plugins/), especially the autoformat handlers.
